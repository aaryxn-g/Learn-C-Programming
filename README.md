# Learn-C-Programming
A beginner-friendly guide to learning C programming, covering fundamental concepts with example codes and explanations.
In this two-hour session, we will quickly revise the essential C programming concepts, focusing on building a solid foundation in:

- Basic Input/Output
- Simple arithmetic and ASCII operations
- Matrices
- Functions
- String Operations
- Pointers
- Structures
- Recursion

This session is perfect for beginners. By the end, youâ€™ll be ready to implement these key concepts in your projects and exams!

## Libraries to Include

Before we start coding, ensure you include the necessary libraries in your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // For standard input/output functions
#include <stdlib.h>  // For standard library functions like malloc, atoi, etc.
#include <string.h>  // For string handling functions
#include <math.h>    // For math operations like sqrt(), pi, etc.
```

## 1. Basic Input/Output

Understanding the various methods for taking input and displaying output is fundamental. Here's a quick reference for the format specifiers:
// Format Specifier for Different Data Types
| Format Specifier | Data Type |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| %d or %i         | int       |
| %c               | char      |
| %f               | float     |
| %lf              | double    |
| %s               | string    |


In C, basic input/output operations are handled using the `stdio.h` library. We use functions like `printf()` to display output on the screen and `scanf()` to take input from the user. Understanding how to use these functions effectively is crucial for writing interactive C programs.
