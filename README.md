## Libraries to Include

Before we start coding, ensure you include the necessary libraries in your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // For standard input/output functions
#include <stdlib.h>  // For standard library functions like malloc, atoi, etc.
#include <string.h>  // For string handling functions
#include <math.h>    // For math operations like sqrt(), pi, etc.
